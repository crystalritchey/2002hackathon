## Acknowledgements
Our project enables Discover to provide Digital Locker feature. The customers can store and access the backup of their digital wallet anytime they want. The backup could include any type of digital keys, ids, credentials, and other types of cryptographic materials.

## Business Challenge
This solution is important because it provides a fully secured implementation for digital backup of digital wallet in the decentralized ID world.  Customers can be worry free about the data they have on their digital wallet during phone loss or compromise. It provides an opportunity to DFS to lead the digital bank by providing this feature.

### Approach
The world is changing to digital and there is no TRUE Digital Locker available in the market. We have vendor specific lockers to store computer hardware related keys or lockers that stores the uploaded documents in digital format. But there is none available which securely store the recovery material and positively identify the identity owner in a decentralized way. People canâ€™t remember all the keys and the physical copy of them are vulnerable. They need a reliable and secure backup. The Digital locker is filling this void space for digital backup. When the mobile device is lost, the holder need not go to each and every issuer to get the IDs reissued. He can just go to Discover Locker to reissue the ID and with that it can access his lost wallet and identities inside of it.

## Vernacular

1. **Digital Wallet**: A financial transaction application that runs on multiple device modalities (mobile, computer). These applications store, manage, and present payment and identity instruments.
3. **DLocker Customer**: Discover locker customer.
4. **Credential Verifier Utility**: A merchant would augment their Checkout Platform with support by a vendor solution that allows consumers to: (a) consent to a digital authentication challenge; (b) present a digital credential for identity verification.
6. **Issuer**: A entity that makes assertions about information and delivers digital credentials containing attestations about those assertions.
7. **Discover Locker API**: A public utility that allows for the registration and discovery of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).
 
## Assumptions
 
1. For the dLocker application the customer digital locker is present in Discover network. 
2. Using the Verity Flow, the Discover issuer and verifier are presented in this use case.
